## The Colon Cancer Corpus

This corpus is organized by documents, named in the format:

[patientID]_[type]_[sequencenum]

Where the patient ID is an arbitrary 3 digit code, the type designates whether the note is a clinical note ("_clinic_") or a pathology note ("_path_"), and the sequence number simply orders the documents within the corpus.
